    My journey began as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, focusing on database automation, before venturing into public policy with the Observer Research Foundation, where I concentrated on data-centric policy issues and organized tech forums.

    I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive products. I bring a results-driven mindset to every product - whether it's optimizing platforms, launching new features, or fostering collaboration.  Let's connect and explore collaborative opportunities.
